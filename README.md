# Sign-Language-Detection
Sign Language Recognition System  Developed a real-time sign language recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and cvzone. Utilized a pre-trained deep learning model to accurately classify various hand gestures captured via webcam. Implemented hand detection, image preprocessing, and gesture classification to translate sign language into text.
The Dataset and virtual environment is not included in this repository, as i have collected the dataset for hand gestures manually using a python program which is included in this repository named as Datacollect.py
