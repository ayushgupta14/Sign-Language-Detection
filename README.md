# Sign-Language-Detection
Sign Language Recognition System  Developed a real-time sign language recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and cvzone. Utilized a pre-trained deep learning model to accurately classify various hand gestures captured via webcam. Implemented hand detection, image preprocessing, and gesture classification to translate sign language into text.
